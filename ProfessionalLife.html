            <p>I have worked a few different jobs over the past few years. During my senior year of high school, I worked in the gift shop and clothing 
                renatal at 
                
                <a href="https://appskimtn.com/"target="_blank">Appalachian Ski Mountain</a>
                
                . Below I have linked a video of all the different slopes they have. After the ski season ended and summer began, I began working for a 
                local orthodontist office called 
                
                <a href="https://www.opsmiles.com/"target="_blank">OPSmiles</a>
                
                . There I was in charge of sterilization and stock. I have worked at OPSmiles the past two summers and Appalachian Ski Mountain 
                the past two winters. While I am at Elon, I work a part time job at

            <p> Before I came to college, I went to Watagua High Schoolate located in Boone, NC. Throughout high school, I was heavily involed in the Theatre and 
                choir program. I was also part of a leadership group called Peer Group Connections. Now at college, I spend a lot of time studying for my classes. 
                To point out a specific one - I spend a lot of my time learning Mandarin. One technique I use for studying is listening to audios of the dialogues 
                we study in that class. An example of the audio I listen to in order to study is linked on the left.
